// Define a User struct which contains 2 fields: 
    // name (string e.g "John")
    // balance (tuple e.g (100.00, "SGD"))

// Define a User method (using impl) 
    // called print_user_detail, which simply prints the name, balance and currency of the user.

// Define an accrue_interest function, which takes in a user and interest percentage as 2 separate parameters. 
    // Within the function, increase the users' balance by the interest percentage, and print out the user details by calling the print_user_detail method. 

fn main() {
    // In the main function, create a user variable of type User, populating the field values of name, and balance and currency. Then, call the accrue_interest function.
    // Bonus: After the call to accrue_interest, call it multiple times so that the user may benefit from compounding interest.
